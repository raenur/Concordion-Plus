<h1>Some Examples of Using Concordion Plus</h1>

<div class="example">
    <h3>Example</h3>

    <div class="scenario" cp:ignore="Work In Progress">
        This is an ignored
        <span c:execute="nonExistantMethod()">section</span>
        which might indicate functionality that is currently being implemented.
    </div>

    <div class="scenario"  cp:scenario="Very Simple Passing Scenario">
        This is a very simple scenario, which doesn't actually do anything but illustrates the markup applied.
    </div>

    <div class="scenario"  cp:scenario="A Scenario With An Error">
        Of course, some scenarios may fail due to
        <span c:execute="anotherNonExistingMethod()">Exceptions.</span>
        And should be marked up accordingly.
    </div>

    <div class="scenario"  cp:scenario="Another Passing Scenario">
        But just because one scenario has an exception,
        should allow other scenarios to be tested and report
        <span c:assertEquals="getText()">success</span> when they pass.
    </div>

    <div class="scenario"  cp:scenario="A Scenario Which Fails">
        And of course, some scenarios may fail with a real
        <span c:assertEquals="getUnexpectedAssertionMessage()">failure</span>
        caused by invalid assumptions, indicating a real failure in the implementation.
    </div>

    <div class="scenario"  cp:ignore="Yet More Work To Do">
        And of course, ignored sections should not execute any of the fixture code,
        which in this case would have resulted in a
        <span c:execute="anotherNonExistantMethod()">exception</span>
        being thrown.
    </div>

    <h3>Using lists for scenarios</h3>
    <ul>
        <li class="scenario" cp:ignore="A list item to do">To <span c:execute="doSomething()">do</span>..., work in progress</li>
        <li class="scenario" cp:scenario="A list item which is done">Something we've done ;)</li>
        <li class="scenario" cp:scenario="Another list item which is done">Something else we've completed</li>
    </ul>
</div>
</body>
</html>
